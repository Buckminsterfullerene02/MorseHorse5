# Bad Rally

Submitted project as part of the [GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023).

You can play the finished project from the [itch.io](https://daman56100.itch.io/bad-rally) page. We hope you have a laugh from the game, as it is shit, but not quite shit enough to be unenjoyable or unplayable.

Out of the three of us working on the project, only myself (Buck) had the rough skillset of using Unreal Engine due to my modding background, so there was a lot of learning by all.

We also forgot about the game jam, so had made plans during the weekend, meaning we couldn't work on it very much. Combined with general laziness/summer tiredness, we couldn't really be bothered to put much serious effort into the project and so just had a lot of fun making a shit game and learning lots more about the engine.
